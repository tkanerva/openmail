To install this service stack, you need to have the dependencies installed.
Refer to requirements.txt for these.

Python 2.7 is recommended.

For a backend storage, I'm using Riak and that's the only k-v store that is currently supported.
Have a local Riak install and modify the port number accordingly.

To use HTTPS/TLS, generate your own keys and put them into server.key and server.crt.
(or cp your already-existing host keys)...

To get stuff running, here's how I start the services:

for ESMTP:
sudo twistd -n --uid=8 --gid=8 mymail  --auth=riak -E -s 25 --relay=/dev/shm/test  --no-pop3 -d openmail.fi=/dev/shm/test2 -s ssl:465:privateKey=/home/topi/cert_and_privkey.pem -H openmail.fi

for POP3/webui:
twistd -ny openmail.tac

N.B. make sure the openmail subdir is in your PYTHONPATH.
